<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently an Algorithm Engineer at Alibaba Group. I obtained PhD in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage), [Prof. Xinping Yi](https://sites.google.com/site/xinpingyi00/), and [Prof. Rui Zhang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/RuiZhang02). My PhD study focuses on advancing <span style="color:#5296C8">Graph Neural Networks</span> under heterogeneous environments, by identifying oversimplified graph assumptions and addressing them through modeling latent structural patterns grounded in reality. I also developed adaptation techniques to tackle <span style="color:#5296C8">Online Distribution Shifts</span>, particularly over real-world small-batch, heterogeneous data streams.
