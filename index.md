<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a final-year Ph.D. candidate  in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Xi Yang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/XiYang01), Prof. [Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage), Prof. [Qiufeng Wang
](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/QiufengWang) and Prof. [Frans Coenen](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/). 
My research focuses on creating adaptable AI solutions that address real-world challenges, specializing in **transfer learning with applications in medical image analysis and autonomous driving systems**.   To this end, I excel in devising algorithms that adeptly manage diverse datasets and unpredictable scenarios. Additionally, I thrive in collaborative environments, working with experts from multiple scientific disciplines to not only merge theoretical insights with practical implementations but also to significantly expand the reach and effectiveness of AI.
