<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently an Algorithm Engineer at Alibaba Group. I obtained PhD in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool in 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Kaizhu Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/kaizhu-huang-homepage), [Prof. Xinping Yi](https://sites.google.com/site/xinpingyi00/), and [Prof. Rui Zhang](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/RuiZhang02). My [PhD study](https://jingweio.github.io/assets/pdf/researchIntro.pdf) is on the modeling and analysis of structured data using <span style="color:#00369f">Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</span>, specifically including 1) identifying and analyzing the inherent limitations of GNNs due to often inappropriate assumptions in complex graph environments; 2) discovering and leveraging latent patterns within these environments to improve the real-world applicability of GNNs. Previously, I received Bsc in Applied Math from Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in 2018.
